            <h1>A story about Sultan Melaka and Putri Gunung Ledang</h1>
            <img src="gambar/ledang2.jpg">
            <p>This story started when Sultan Melaka sent a convoy led by Hang Tuah to propose to the Putri who 
                lived at the top of Gunung Ledang. Putri knew that Sultan Melaka had many wives and 
                concubines and this convoy was nothing but full of lust. Several times Hang Tuah 
                and his convoy returned to the castle with empty hand. Sultan took this sign as a challenge
                that Putri was trying to play push and pull <em>"tarik tali"</em>.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Thus, Sultan offered everything in his kingdom in order to get married with her.
                    One day, Putri told the convoy that she will accept the proposal if Sultan fulfill 
                    these 7 sacred requirements.

                    <ul>
                        <li>7 Dulang Hati Nyamuk</li>
                        <li>7 Dulang Hati Kuman</li>
                        <li>7 Dulang Air Mata Anak Dara</li>
                        <li>7 Dulang Air Pinang Muda</li>
                        <li>1 Jambatan Emas dari Gunung ledang ke Melaka</li>
                        <li>1 Jambatan Perak dari Gunung ledang ke Melaka</li>
                        <li>1 Mangkuk Darah Anak Lelaki Raja Melaka</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Sultan Melaka was arrogant and and forced his subjects to do it.
                    All virgins were gathered to cry for 7 days and 7 nights. All scholars were prohibited to go home, 
                    brainstorming how to gather "hati kuman and hati nyamuk". Any men in his kingdom must work
                    building the bridges.Sultan Melaka did not care about his people well-being and pressuring to make it faster.
                    Until the minister told Sultan Melaka about the last requirement; 
                    <blockquote>1 Mangkuk Darah Anak Lelaki Raja Melaka</blockquote>
                    He fell onto the ground knowing he only had 1 son and the only crown prince.
                    When Putri came and demanded the requirements to be presented, only 6 were present. Sultan told Putri
                    that he did not have heart to murder his own son. So he asked the engagement to be canceled.

    <h1>Moral of the Story</h1>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>It is a reminder to the people that certain leaders are sellfish and not worthy to obey</li>
            <li>Old people have better language understanding as rejection commonly came in hyperbole to keep the dignity of other parties</li>
            <li></li>

        <p>This sharing is merely my interest in folktales and tradition
            <br><br>
        None of the contents here represent the actual histories, figures or even faith 
            <br><br>
        I just want to share the informations <br>because my late mother used to tell me these stories for my bedtime
            <br><br>
        In addition, some Malay folklores are no longer practised as it against Islamic faith.
            <br><br>
        But, i simply cannot let my ancestors stories vanish in a thin air.
            <br><br>
        Thus, here I am sharing with you guys.
            <br><br>
        Selamat Menelaah
