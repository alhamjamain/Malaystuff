            <h2>Pinggan Mangkuk</h2>
            <p>In the old day where people rarely lived in luxury life,if there was an event such as 
                weeding ceremony or any big celebration people would serve foods on ceramic plate and bowl
                for the guests. Besides to express the gratitude some took it further as to flaunt their wealth.
                This situation drove some Malays to seek help from entity(ies). Sungai Pinggan at Benut Pontian
                is a famous place for people like this. Some claimed if you bring yellow silk cloth with 
                other items such as foods and gold, and you invoke an entity called <em>Putri Pinggan</em>, She
                will give you a set of ceramic plate and bowl to be used. However, it comes with terms. Firstly
                you must retun it on time depending on <em>Putri's</em> wish. Secondly, the set must have no damage and clean.</p><br>
					<p>
                Common story if people failed to do so, <em>Putri</em> will burden your life such as make your sorrounding
                hate you for no reason, you become easily irritated and the list go on. Basically the equivalent of <em>Ahlong</em> throw red paint. 
               There are 2 version of stories of why pinggan mangkuk transaction is no longer exist. The first due to many people betrayed the promise. 
               Secondly, some said there was an elephant/bear came to the Sungai Pinggan and break all the items.

            <h2>Tiang  Seri Rumah</h2>
            <p>In the old Malay belief, each time someone wanted to build a home they must design a house with a  pillar in the middle of 
                main portion of house such as living room or typically called as <em>rumah ibu</em>. It is called <em>Tiang Seri</em> and the meaning behind it is 
                main pillar. From engineering and architecture perspectives, this pillar serves no purpose either the aesthetic or safety. 
                However the sole reason is to be a place for entities bounded to be so called <em>guardian of the house</em>.</p><br><br>
					<p> 
                Most of the time the choices of entities varies depending on the specific cultures, bloodline or needs. People believed that the 
                guardian will protect the house from wild entities or people with bad intentions. Usually the owner or the binder/summoner must feed
                these entities regularly based on the aggrements. Some houses with Tiang Seri filled with entities will wrap the pillar with 
                royal yellow cloth.

            <h2>Mandi Bunga</h2>
            <p> <em>Mandi Bunga</em> is still a popular practice among Malay today. This practiced was considered a ritual from Hindhu-Budha and Dinamisme belief.
                Back then, people believed that human are part of nature and we always fill each other energy. Each element used in this flowery bath
                has its own meaning. Lime is used to fend bad spirits, 7 types of flowers help to amplify you energy or <em>semangat</em> and give 
                flowery smell and salt to detoxify the bad things in your body. That is why it was used to be a mandatory ritual for <em>Sultan</em>
                or Crown Prince/<em>Tengku Mahkota</em> to go through this before the coronation day. 
</p><br><br>Since this practice is pretty much same with Hinddu faith,
                Royals decided not to make it mandatory as it will bring confusion to muslims even right now we have guidlines of
                Mandi Bunga that does not against Islamic faith.
