            <h1>A miracle of why Johor never got colonised</h1>
            <img src="jatadansultan.jpg" width="800" height="440" >
            <p>Have you guys heard a rumour as why Johor never got colonised violently by British or Japan?</p>
                <br>
                <p> Yes, it is because Sultan Johor made a wise move by establishing diplomat with several big empires,
                    resulting Victorian Queen of Britain and Emperor Maiji from Japan admit the soveriengthy of Johor state
                </p>
                <br>
                
                <br>
                <p>But this is not history lesson guys. We are talking about fairytales!.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>It is said that Sultan made this action due to the wisdom given by the two special tigers known as 
                    Dengkis and Tepok. These two tigers believed will guard state of Johor as long as the royals still exist.
                    During British colonised Tanah Melayu, there was a group of British army tried to infliritated Johor disobey 
                    the diplomacy of Johor and Britian. However their plan was distrupted due to the roaring sound that was so loud
                    that hurt their ears and bleeding.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Some other versions said, Johor has these powerful guardian best due to Dengkis and Tepok used to be wild spirit.
                    Until one day, they harmed Johoreans and a powerful so called <em>Laksamana</em> challanged them. 
                    Laksaman won the battle and punish both of them to guard Johor until either the world ends or the royal line is broken.
                </p>

                <br>
                <p>However, this story exists due to the error on Jata Negeri Johor. As you guys can see above where there is old versions pf Jata Negeri Johor 
                    which the tiger at the left has 3 fingers while at right has 4 fingers. These errors considered as a result of Dengkis and Tepok their battle.

        In addition, some Malay folklores are no longer practised as it against Islamic faith.
