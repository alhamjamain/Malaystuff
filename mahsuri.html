        <p>Mahsuri was the daughter of a Phuket Malay who moved from their native Phuket Province 
            also known as Tanjung Salang or Junkcelyon by European to the island of Langkawi in search of a better life.
             She was the most beautiful woman in all of Langkawi and married the warrior Wan Darus. 
             As was required of him, her husband had to go to war on behalf of Kedah against Thailand, 
             leaving Mahsuri behind to fend for herself. It was during this time that Mahsuri befriended a young traveler named Deramang.
              The village chief's wife Wan Mahora was jealous of Mahsuri's beauty. 
              She spread a rumour that Mahsuri was unfaithful and was having an affair with Deramang in the absence of Wan Darus. 
              Eventually, the rumours grew strong enough that the villagers openly accused her of adultery. 
              Mahsuri pleaded her innocence, but no one believed her.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Mahsuri was to be tied to a tree and stabbed to death but it didn't work. 
            After every execution attempt failed, Mahsuri told them to kill her with her family's 'keris'. 
            When she was stabbed, white blood flowed from the wound, signifying her innocence. 
            Some birds flew above her to cover her body. With her dying breath, Mahsuri cursed Langkawi to have seven generations of bad luck.
             The kingdom was soon raided by the Siamese armada. 
             The villagers at Padang Mat Sirat burned their paddy fields rather than let them fall into the hands of the Siamese.
             Mahsuri's family later returned to Siam

        <p>This sharing is merely my interest in folktales and tradition
            <br><br>
        None of the contents here represent the actual histories, figures or even faith 
            <br><br>
        I just want to share the informations <br>because my late mother used to tell me these stories for my bedtime
            <br><br>
        In addition, some Malay folklores are no longer practised as it against Islamic faith.
            <br><br>
        But, i simply cannot let my ancestors stories vanish in a thin air.
            <br><br>
        Thus, here I am sharing with you guys.
            <br><br>
        Selamat Menelaah
